Machine Learning &amp; Statistics @ ATU 2022

This README contains a summary of various topics within the module, with reference material included for each topic.  

Topic 1: Statistics (Lady Tasting Tea, Hypotheses, t-tests, ANOVA)  

Statistical analysis involves collecting and analysing data in our datasets in order to find useful trends/insights.  
Many analyses in this notebook such as hypotheses, t-tests and ANOVA tests help data analysts to look at data and find meaningful results that can assist businesses.

Topic 2: Models (Mathematical, Lines)  

Data modelling refers to a set of tools used to understand how businesses should be using their valuable data.  
It is critical that the data analysts create effective models that communicate vital information to upper management such as a good or bad change in a specified trend.

Topic 3: Parameters (Polyfit, Polynomials)  

Parameters are characteristics used to define a given population in a dataset.  
Parameters can describe a specific characteristic from the entire population such as the mean.
